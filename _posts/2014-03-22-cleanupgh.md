Join Us For Our First Event - Let's #CleanUpGitHub!

Not long ago, [Tom Morris](http://tommorris.org/posts/8053) blogged about a search he did on GitHub for [words like 'faggot'](https://github.com/search?q=faggot&ref=searchresults&type=Code), ['bitches'](https://github.com/search?l=c&p=1&q=bitches&ref=searchresults&type=Code) and other offensive things.

The results surprised him - me - and many others reading the post.

Laid bare was a prime example of ignorance being bliss, people publicly posting code with comments and class names that could make so many people feel awful, unwanted, and excluded.

Mostly, these things aren't written with the desire to offend, but with an ignorance of the damage their comments and class names can cause. With just a little education, so many people might look twice at their code and clean it up. And so, with that in mind, I give you our first event.
<br /><br />
# Saturday 22nd March, 12:00 - 20:00 GMT
## The first #CleanUpGitHub pull-request-a-thon.
<br />

In the spirit of positive action, I invite you to join us in raising mass-awareness of this unfortunate issue by finding and changing as many vulgar, offensive, exclusive code comments and names as we can.

We can't force developers to change their code - but eight hours of pull requests from ethical coders the world over might just make people stop, think, and change their ways.

For those of you who can get to London, I've secured a venue for us to get together in person - keep hydrated and fed - and work as a team to get this done. Details and registration [are on the Eventbrite page](http://cleanupgh.eventbrite.co.uk). If you want to get people together in another location, let us know and we'll set you up an eventbrite page. This is by the community, for the community.

For those who don't want to join us in person, #CleanUpGitHub is just as accessible remotely, and the more people who take part the better. We'll post more details here as the day gets closer.

I hope you'll join us, remotely or otherwise, in showing the world that there's a better way to code.

###Frequently Asked Questions

| Is this a hackathon? Can I come along and build stuff? |
| ------------- |
| It's not a hackathon - but yes, you can come along and build stuff. It's a place for the community to get together and take positive action. The goal is to make pull requests on offending GitHib repos, but we value any/all support people want to give!   | 

| Is this just a gimmick? What will it really achieve? |
| ------------- |
| That depends on your definition of gimmick - and whether or not you think that's a bad thing. We know that people can just close these pull requests without actually accepting the changes proposed - but the idea isn't to get people to accept everything we try to change. It's about making a stand, making some noise, and raising awareness of the issue.   | 

| What about genuine uses of offensive language in code i.e. blacklists? How will you ensure this is targeting actual offensiveness and not just be too PC? |
| ------------- |
| We're working on something that will do searching and tracking during the event - but the whole point of getting real people together to do this is to add a human element. Everyone will be encouraged to use common sense and not just edit things for the sake of it.  | 

| I want to come along. Is there going to be food? |
| ------------- |
| There'll definitely be beverages. We're working on finding a way to provide food for everyone too, but right now the event is funded out of our own pockets. If you know someone who might want to sponsor the event and pay for food, please [get in touch!](mailto:hello@ethicalco.de)!

| I live a billion miles away from London but want to take part in person. Can I? |
| ------------- |
| If you want to bring people from within your local community together to have an in-person event near you, please, go for it. Please [let us know](mailto:hello@ethicalco.de) so that we can include you in PR and set you up with an Eventbrite page, but we do strongly encourage people to gather in their own areas if they aren't local to London. Let's face it, there's a lot of world out there.    |
