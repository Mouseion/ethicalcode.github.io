Join Us For Our First Event - Let's #CleanUpGitHub!

Not long ago, [Tom Morris](http://tommorris.org/posts/8053) blogged about a search he did on GitHub for [words like 'faggot'](https://github.com/search?q=faggot&ref=searchresults&type=Code), ['bitches'](https://github.com/search?l=c&p=1&q=bitches&ref=searchresults&type=Code) and other such things. The results surprised him - me - and many others reading the post. Laid bare was a prime example of ignorance being bliss, people publicly posting code with comments and class names that could make so many people feel awful, unwanted, and excluded.

Mostly, these thigs aren't written with the desire to offend, but with an ignorance of the damage their comments and class names can cause. These people need educating.

# Saturday 22nd March, 12:00 - 20:00 GMT
## The first #CleanUpGitHub pull-request-a-thon.
In the spirit of positive action, I invite you to join me in raising mass-awareness of this unfortunate issue by finding and changing as many vulgar, offensive, exclusive code comments and names as we can.

We can't force developers to change their code - but eight hours of pull requests from ethical coders the world over might just make people stop, think, and change their ways.

For those of you who can get to London, I've secured a venue for us to get together in person - keep hydrated and fed - and work as a team to get this done. Details and registration [are on the Eventbrite page](http://). If you want to get people together in another location, let us know and we'll set you up an eventbrite page. This is by the community, for the community.

For those who can't, #CleanUpGitHub is just as accessible remotely, and the more people who take part the better. We'll post more details here as the day gets closer.

I hope you'll join us, remotely or otherwise, in showing the world that there's a better way to code.
